## Getting started üöÄ
### Prerequisites
To use this template, [`copier`](https://github.com/copier-org/copier?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) must be installed.

It is recommended to install both tools as follows:

```
pip install pipx
pipx install copier
pip install pipenv --user
```

```
